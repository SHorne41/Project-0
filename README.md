# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For the purpose of this project, I chose to write a short Wiki on the card game Yu-Gi-Oh! 

The landing page (index.html) has a brief introduction to the game, as well as a Table of Contents that outlines the contents 
of each of the other 3 pages.

Those three other pages include Monster Cards (monsterCards.html), Spell Cards (spellCards.html), and Trap Cards (trapCards.html)

The Bootstrap feature that I chose to incorporate into my project is their navigation bar. This allows the user to navigate
from any page to any other page in the website.
