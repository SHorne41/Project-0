                <p class="pageDescription">
                Trap cards are the third and final kind of card that can be played in a Yu-Gi-Oh duel. As the name
                implies, these cards are used to set traps for your opponent. Consequently, they cannot be activated
                directly from a duelist's hand. Instead, duelists must place the card face-down during their turn, and
                they must wait until the start of their opponent's next turn before they can activate their trap. As
                we will soon see, there are 3 different types of trap cards: Normal traps, Continuous traps, and Counter
                traps. Similar to spell cards, each type of trap card has an icon under its name that allows a duelist to
                distinguish it from others.

                A Normal trap card is the most basic type of trap; their effect can be actiavted at any time, and once
                their effect has resolved, they're destroyed. Often times, Normal trap cards will be triggered by a
                certain event. Take <i>Treacherous Trap Hole</i>, for instance. This card can be activated when a
                monster is summoned to the field (provided the card's owner doesn't have any traps in their Graveyard).
                If so, it can destroy any two monsters on the field. These trap cards do not have an icon to specify
                their type, which is their distinguishing feature, and they have a spell speed of 2 (meaning they can be
                activated in response to an opponent's magic or trap card).

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Continuous traps, similar to Normal traps, can have their effects triggered by certain events that occur
                on the playing field. However, unlike Normal traps, Continuous traps remain on the field until they're
                destoryed by another effect. These effects can inlude other magic or trap cards, a monster's effect, or
                a monster's destruction. For example, the <i>Spellbinding Circle</i> seen above remains on the field
                until the monster it's targeting is destroyed. Continuous traps can be identified by the infinity logo
                found under the card's name, and they have a spell speed of 2.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Counter traps are the most versatile trap card in the game, simply due to their superior spell speed (3).
                Among both magic and trap cards, Counter traps are the only cards that possess such a spell speed, meaning
                they can be used in response to ANY card's activation. Furthermore, only other Counter traps can be used
                in response to a Counter trap's activation. <i>Divine Wrath</i> (pictured above) is a great example, as it's
                effect is triggred in response to a monster activating it's effect (Spell Speed 2). When this occurs, the owner
                of the <i>Divine Wrath</i> can discard a card, at which time the monster's effect is negated, and the monster
                is destroyed. Counter traps can be identified by the arrow logo under the card's name, and they are destroyed
                once their effects have resolved.
