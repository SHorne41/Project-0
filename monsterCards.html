                <h1 class="pageTitle">Monsters Cards</h1>
                <p class="pageDescription">Monster cards are one of three different kinds of cards in Duel Mosnters.
                All monster cards, regardless of their nature, share these commonalities: they each have a level
                (indicated by a number of stars under their name), a type (indicated on the first line of their text),
                an attribute (located in the top right corner of the card), an attack strength (located in the bottom
                right corner of the card), and a defence value (adjacent to the attack strength). However, while they
                may have several things in common, there are several different kinds of monster cards. On this page,
                we will explore five different kinds of monster cards. Please note: monster card types other than the
                ones listed on this page do exist (e.g: XYZ monsters, Pendulum monsters and Link monsters).</p>

                <img class="cardImg" src="/assets/images/monsterCardImages/exodiaArm.png">
                <p class="cardDescription">Normal monsters, along with effect monsters and fusion monsters, are among
                the first monsters types created. While these monsters do not boast any special effects, they tend to
                have higher attack and defence stats than their effect counterparts. These monsters can be summoned to
                the field without any special summoning procedures. Normal monster cards can be distinguished by their
                beige coloured background, as seen in the image above.</p>

                <img class="cardImg" src="/assets/images/monsterCardImages/exodia.jpg">
                <p class="cardDescription">Effect monsters, similar to Normal monsters, do not require any special
                procedures in order to be summoned to the field. However, they possess special abilities that allow a
                duelist to be more strategic; effects can often be used to hinder an opponent's gameplan as well as
                bolster the user's. There are many different types of effects a monster can possess, inluding:
                flip effects, trigger effects, summoning effects... Effect monsters can be distinguished from other
                monster card types by their orange coloured background, as seen in the image above.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-4 col-sm-6" align="center">

                <img class="cardImg" src="/assets/images/monsterCardImages/fiveHeadedDragon.jpg">
                <p class="cardDescription">Fusion monsters were the first monsters to require special summoning
                procedures. First, a duelist must have the required "fusion material" (listed in the fusion card's
                text) in their hand or on the field. Next, the duelist must activate a spell card known as
                <i>Polimerization</i> which sends the fusion material to the graveyard, thus allowing the duelist to
                summon the Fusion monster. Because fusion monsters require special summoning proedures, they're
                typically stronger than Normal and Effect monsters. Fusion monsters can be distinguished by their
                purple background color, as seen in the image above.</p>

                <img class="cardImg" src="/assets/images/monsterCardImages/relinquished.png">
                <p class="cardDescription">Ritual monsters, similar to Fusion monsters, are subject to special
                summoning procedures using a magic card. However, they cannot be summoned using <i>Polimerization</i>
                , but rather using the spell card listed in the Ritual monster's text. Furthermore, they do not
                require specfic monsters to be tributed; instead, the combined level of the sacrificed monsters
                must be equal to or greater than the level of the Ritual monster being summoned to the field.
                Similar to Fusion monsters, the monsters used for a ritual summon can be either in the player's hand or
                on the field. Ritual monsters can be distinguished by their blue background color, as seen in the image
                above.</p>

                <p class="cardDescription">Synchro monsters also require special summonming procedures. However,
                unlike Fusion and Ritual monsters, Synchro monsters can be summoned without any magic cards. Instead,
                they are special summoned to the field by sacrificing monsters who meet the following criteria: first,
                one of the monsters must be a Tuner type, and second, the combined level of the sacrificed monsters
                must be EQUAL to (and not greater than) the level of the Synchro monster being summoned to the field.
                Furthermore, these monsters MUST be on the field (unlike Fusion and Ritual summons). Lastly, different
                Synchro monsters may have additional requirements in order to be summoned to the field (specified in the
                card's text). Synchro monsters can be distinguished by their white background color, as seen in the image
                above.</p>
