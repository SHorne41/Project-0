                Normal spell cards allow a duelist to activate strategic effects. After they're effects
                have taken place, the card is destroyed and sent to the graveyard. These cards are among
                the slowest in terms of Spell Speed (Spell Speed 1), and therefore cannot be activated
                beyond the first link in a chain. These cards have no icon to distinguish them from other
                magic cards, which is subsequently their distinguishing feature.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Equip spell cards allow a duelist to give one of their monsters special abilites, such as
                increased attack/defence, or the ability to inflict piercing damage, for instance. These
                cards also have a Spell Speed of 1, and therefore cannot be activated beyond the first link
                in a chain. These cards remain face-up on the field until an opponent destroys them using a
                magic/trap card of their own, or until the monster to which the card is equipped is destroyed.
                Equip spells can be identified by the cross under the card name, as seen in the image above.

                Continuous spell cards grant special abilities as long as the card remains face-up on the
                field. While these effects can include abilities such as awarding a duelist's monsters with
                additional attack/defence strength, they may also be a requirement to summon certain types of
                monsters. This is true of most <i>Toon</i> monsters, which cannot be summoned to the field unless
                <i>Toon World</i> (pictured above) is on the field. Continuous spells remain face-up on the field
                until an opponent destroys them with a spell/trap card, they have the slowest Spell Speed (1), and
                they can be identified by the infinity symbol under the card's name, as seen in the image above.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Quick-play spell cards are similar to Normal spell cards, except that they have a greater Spell
                Speed (2). This means Quick-play spells can be activated in response to another card's activation,
                so long as <i>sed</i> card does not have a Spell Speed of 3. Quick-play spells can also be activated
                during an opponent's turn. For instance, <i>Enemy Controller</i> (pictured above) is often used to
                switch an attacking monster into Defence mode, thus sparing a duelist's monsters/Life points from the
                assault. These cards, like Normal Spell cards, are destroyed after their effects are resolved. Quick-
                play spells can be identified by the lightning bolt symbol located under the card name.
