                Spells are the second of three different types of cards in Yu-Gi-Oh. These cards have a
                wide variety of effects, which typically include: boosting the strenght of your own monsters,
                weakening the strength of your opponent's monsters, increasing your own Life Points, and
                destroying your opponent's spell and trap cards, among others. There are six different types
                of magic cards, all of which are briefly explained below. A duelist should note that the type
                of a given magic card can be found directly below the card's name.

                Normal spell cards allow a duelist to activate strategic effects. After they're effects
                have taken place, the card is destroyed and sent to the graveyard. These cards are among
                the slowest in terms of Spell Speed (Spell Speed 1), and therefore cannot be activated
                beyond the first link in a chain. These cards have no icon to distinguish them from other
                magic cards, which is subsequently their distinguishing feature.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Equip spell cards allow a duelist to give one of their monsters special abilites, such as
                increased attack/defence, or the ability to inflict piercing damage, for instance. These
                cards also have a Spell Speed of 1, and therefore cannot be activated beyond the first link
                in a chain. These cards remain face-up on the field until an opponent destroys them using a
                magic/trap card of their own, or until the monster to which the card is equipped is destroyed.
                Equip spells can be identified by the cross under the card name, as seen in the image above.

                Continuous spell cards grant special abilities as long as the card remains face-up on the
                field. While these effects can include abilities such as awarding a duelist's monsters with
                additional attack/defence strength, they may also be a requirement to summon certain types of
                monsters. This is true of most <i>Toon</i> monsters, which cannot be summoned to the field unless
                <i>Toon World</i> (pictured above) is on the field. Continuous spells remain face-up on the field
                until an opponent destroys them with a spell/trap card, they have the slowest Spell Speed (1), and
                they can be identified by the infinity symbol under the card's name, as seen in the image above.

                Quick-play spell cards are similar to Normal spell cards, except that they have a greater Spell
                Speed (2). This means Quick-play spells can be activated in response to another card's activation,
                so long as <i>sed</i> card does not have a Spell Speed of 3. Quick-play spells can also be activated
                during an opponent's turn. For instance, <i>Enemy Controller</i> (pictured above) is often used to
                switch an attacking monster into Defence mode, thus sparing a duelist's monsters/Life points from the
                assault. These cards, like Normal Spell cards, are destroyed after their effects are resolved. Quick-
                play spells can be identified by the lightning bolt symbol located under the card name.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Field spells cards are unique, as they have a zone designated specifically for them on the game mat.
                A field spell typically grants power boosts or special abilities to all monsters on the field that
                meet certain criteria. For example, the field spell illustrated above, <i>Toon Kingdom</i>, allows
                any "Toon" monster to attack their opponent directly (bipassing any monsters they have on the field).
                It also grants these monsters immunity from any card effects, as well as protection from oncoming
                attacks (so long as we banish the top card of our deck face-down). While these effects can be very
                powerful, they have an inherent flaw in that your opponent benefits from these effects as well (so
                long as they have monsters that meet the criteria). Field spells remain on the field until they are
                destroyed by another card, or until another field spell is activated (by the duelist who originally
                activated it). They have the lowest Spell Speed (1), and can be distinguished by the star icon under
                the card's name.

                <p class="cardDescription">
                Ritual spell cards are used to special summon Ritual monsters (see Monster Cards page). Without these
                cards, Ritual Monsters cannot be summoned to the field. When performing a Ritual summon, monsters must
                be sacrificed. The combined level of those monsters must meet or exceed the level of the Ritual monster
                we are summoning to the field. In the case of <i>Black Luster Ritual</i>, pictured above, the combined
                level of the sacrificed monsters must be 8 or higher, as the <i>Black Luster Soldier</i> is a level 8
                monster. Ritual spells have the slowest Spell Speed (1), they are destroyed when their effect has been
                resolved, and they can be distinguished by the fire icon directly below the card's name.
